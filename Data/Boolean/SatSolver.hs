-- This Haskell library provides an implementation of the
-- Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland algorithm
-- (cf. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL_algorithm>) for the boolean
-- satisfiability problem. It not only allows to solve boolean
-- formulas in one go but also to add constraints and query bindings
-- of variables incrementally.
-- 
-- The implementation is not sophisticated at all but uses the basic
-- DPLL algorithm with unit propagation.
